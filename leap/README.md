# Leap

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```text
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leap
year, but 2000 is.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

To run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

## Further improvements
To format the code solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if the code solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```
